## Data Privacy

We take data privacy seriously and have implemented multiple layers of protection:

### Data Anonymization
- No exact salary figures are stored or displayed
- All salary data is standardized into ranges with Â±7% variance
- Displayed values are rounded to nearest 500 TL
- Company names are optional and can be replaced with industry categories
- User profiles never display actual salary amounts

### User Protection
- Email verification required for account creation
- Secure password hashing and storage
- Option to use anonymous communication tokens
- No public profile information beyond username
- Early adopter badges and reputation scores don't reveal personal data

### Data Display
- Scatter plots use variance to prevent exact salary identification
- Salary ranges are aggregated for distribution charts
- Company statistics only shown when sufficient data exists
- Position titles are standardized to prevent individual identification
- Experience levels are grouped to maintain anonymity

### Technical Measures

- Secure session management
- Regular security audits
- Database encryption at rest
- Rate limiting on sensitive operations
- IP address anonymization

### User Control
